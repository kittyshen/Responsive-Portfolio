                <p>I consider myself a mixture of all different ingredients. Love cats, games, doing app coding, design and make things visually pleasing, dancing ,sking, driving... too much to list. It's out of scoop of this short intro.</p>

                    I myself is a big gamer throughout my whole life. Still remember the excitement from the joy of playing my first NES game named Tetris till this day, so I am really an old school gamer. </p>

                    My friend Andrew introduced me to the tools I used in developing the game. Which are all free software. Game graphic done with Inkscape, free vector drawing tool. Coding and integration done with Unity game engine. I learned to code mainly by watching free youtube video tutorials and google search on the internet. There are lots of very helpful software programmers on github.com, stackoverflow and unity forums. They posted problems they encountered during their app development, usually you can find your information you needed by refine your search keyword on google.               
                </p>
                <p>Ever since then, I developed and released serveral app on android and ios stores.</p>
